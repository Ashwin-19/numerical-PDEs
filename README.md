# Numerical Partial Differential Equations

Implementations of Numerical Methods for the course MTH598 Numerical Partial Differential Equations taken by Dr. Kaushik Kalyanraman at IIIT Delhi during the Winter 2020 Semester.

## Course Description

This course will provide an overview of two standard numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs). The focus will be on essential theoretical analysis as well as computer implementation.

+ The first part will be on finite difference methods. Key numerical schemes and underlying theory will be provided for one-dimensional parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential equations. This will be followed by a short foray into linear system solvers and finite difference scheme for two-dimensional Poissonâ€™s (elliptic) problem.
+ The second part of the course will deal with finite element methods exclusively for elliptic problems. The core ideas in functional analysis, variational formulation, error analysis, and computer implementation will be presented for the one-dimensional problem. This will be followed be a more practical treatment of two-dimensional problems.
+ The last part will consist of an overview of the specialized topics of mixed and adaptive finite element methods.
